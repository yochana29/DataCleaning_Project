# DataCleaning_Project

This data cleaning project aims to prepare a dataset for analysis by removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, handling null values, and removing unnecessary columns. The process involves creating a staging table, identifying and deleting duplicate records using window functions, and updating data types and values to ensure consistency. Finally, rows with missing critical information are removed, and the cleaned dataset is ready for further analysis.
