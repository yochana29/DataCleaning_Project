#Data Cleaning and Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning a dataset containing details of company layoffs. The dataset includes key fields such as company, location, industry, total laid off, percentage laid off, date, stage, country, and funds raised.

Data Cleaning:
The cleaning phase focuses on ensuring data consistency and quality. Duplicates are identified and removed, while fields like company names, industry, and dates are standardized. Missing values in the dataset are handled by filling in gaps based on related records, and unnecessary or null rows are deleted. SQL techniques such as partitioning, updates, and joins are used extensively to refine the dataset.

Data Analysis:
The analysis component explores trends in layoffs across companies and industries. Key metrics include total employees laid off by company, year, and industry, as well as rolling totals by month. The project ranks companies based on layoffs and highlights those with the highest layoffs per year. Techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions are used to perform cumulative and ranked analyses, offering insights into the impact of layoffs over time.

Summary:
This project demonstrates the process of transforming raw layoffs data into a structured, clean dataset ready for analysis, providing valuable insights into workforce trends across industries.
